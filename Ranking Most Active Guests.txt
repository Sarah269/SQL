-- Rank guests based on the number messages they've exchanged
-- with hosts.  Guest with the same number of messages as other guests should have the same rank. 
-- Do not skip rankings if the preceding rankings are identical.
-- Output the rank, guest id, and number of total messages they've sent. 
-- Order by the highest number of total messages first.

-- Create CTE summing messages by guest
with CTE1 AS (
select id_guest, sum(n_messages) as num_msg
 from airbnb_contacts
 group by id_guest
 order by num_msg desc)

-- Rank messages 
 select 
 dense_rank() over (order by num_msg desc) as msg_rank, *
  from CTE1
