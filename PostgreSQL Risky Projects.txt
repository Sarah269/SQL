-- Identify projects that are at risk for going overbudget.  A project is considered to be 
-- overbudget if the cost of all employees assigined to the project is greater than the budget 
-- of the project.
--You'll need to prorate the cost of the employees to the duration of the project.  For example,
-- if the budget for a project that takes half a year to complete is $10K, then the total half-
-- year salary of all employees assigned to the project should not exceed $10K.  Salary is
-- defined on a yearly basis, so be careful how to calculate salaries for the projects
-- that last less or more than one year.
-- Output a list of projects that are overbudget with their project name, project budget, and 
-- prorated total employee expense(rounded to the next dollar amount)
