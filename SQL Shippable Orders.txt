Find the percentage of shipable orders.
Consider an order is shipable if the customer's address is known.


-- Join orders and customer tables
-- select order id, customer id, and address
With CTE1 AS (
select
o.id
,o.cust_id
,c.address
from orders o
join customers c
on o.cust_id = c.id
)

-- count # of orders with addresses
-- count total # of orders
-- calculate percent of orders that are shippable
select tot_orders, canship, (canship/tot_orders)*100
from (
select
(select count(*) from CTE1 )as tot_orders,
(select count(*) 
from CTE1 where address is not null) as canship) as c_orders
